* [Link to my homepage](https://juntangzhuang.com)
* This is repository for my paper [ShelfNet for real-time semantic segmentation](https://juntang-zhuang.github.io/files/ShelfNet_2019.pdf), and avhieves both fast inference speed and high segmentation accuracy<br>
* This implementation is based on [torch-encoding](https://github.com/zhanghang1989/PyTorch-Encoding). Main difference is the structure of the model.

# Requirement
* Please refer to [torch-encoding](https://github.com/zhanghang1989/PyTorch-Encoding) for implementation on synchronized batch-normalization layer.
* run ```python setup.py install``` to configure environments
